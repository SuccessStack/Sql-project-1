# üìä Walmart Sales Data Analysis using MYSQL

## üìù About the Project

This project explores the Walmart Sales dataset to gain insights into:

- Top-performing branches and product lines
- Sales trends across different dimensions
- Customer behavior and segmentation
- Optimization opportunities for sales strategies

## üß∞ Approach Used

### 1. Data Wrangling
- Inspected the data for null/missing values.
- No null values detected (all fields set to `NOT NULL` at database creation).

### 2. Feature Engineering
- `time_of_day`: Morning, Afternoon, Evening (from transaction time)
- `day_name`: Day of the week (Mon‚ÄìSun)
- `month_name`: Month name (Jan‚ÄìDec)

### 3. Database Creation
- Tables created and populated using SQL.
- Views and queries structured for performance analysis.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analysis conducted to answer specific business questions on product sales, customer segments, and sales trends.

## üßÆ Revenue and Profit Calculations

### Formulas:

- **COGS** = `unit_price √ó quantity`
- **VAT** = `0.05 √ó COGS`
- **Total (gross sales)** = `COGS + VAT`
- **Gross Income** = `Total - COGS`
- **Gross Margin** = `Gross Income / Total`
